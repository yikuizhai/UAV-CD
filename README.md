A SCALE-TEMPORAL INTERACTION NETWORK FOR REMOTE SENSING IMAGE CHANGE DETECTION AND A UAV-CD DATASET(Paper presented at the 2024 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (IGARSS), link to be updated when the paper can be retrieved.)

## Introduction

Based on the UAV-BCD[[UAV-BCD: A UAV Building Change Detection Dataset | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10281907)], we further enriched the sample diversity and expanded the sample size by adding land changes in addition to building changes, expanding the samples from 2024 to 2660. Specifically, UAV-CD consists of a total of 2660 pairs of 768Ã— 768 pixel UAV optical images with a spatial resolution of 0.06m. In terms of building changes, it mainly involves building additions and demolitions.
